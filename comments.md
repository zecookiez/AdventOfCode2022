- Day 1: Missed out on top 100 because I decided to test my code, and then misread part 2

- Day 2: I actually got points o_o, ran into a bug for part 2 but I'm glad to find some signs of hope for this year

- Day 3: Very happy about my performance today!! Got points on both parts despite running into a few bugs. I'm a little bit tilted that I lost out on points to people abusing OpenAI and Copilot to solve the challenge. Can't imagine how they can enforce this unfortunately.
