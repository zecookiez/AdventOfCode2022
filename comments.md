- Day 1: Missed out on top 100 because I decided to test my code, and then misread part 2

- Day 2: I actually got points o_o, ran into a bug for part 2 but I'm glad to find some signs of hope for this year

- Day 3: Very happy about my performance today!! Got points on both parts despite running into a few bugs. I'm a little bit tilted that I lost out on points to people abusing OpenAI and Copilot to solve the challenge. Can't imagine how they can enforce this unfortunately.

- Day 4: Lost out on points for part 1 because my regex caught the dash as a negative sign, this one is on me. I count at least 2 people who used ChatGPT in today's leaderboard :/

- Day 5: This is on the board for one of the worst input formats. In retrospect I should've hardcoded the input for the extra speed, but I prefer solutions that work on various inputs :")

- Day 6: Did well today, not sure why this is day 6. 

- Day 7: Forgot that directories can have duplicate names..........................................

- Day 8: I tried to be smart and wrote it without brute-force for part 1. It did NOT work, and did NOT extend to part 2 ;---; Need to learn when to use brute-force, gg go next 

- Day 9: Cool problem, but there's too much thinking... I'm just glad I got points today
