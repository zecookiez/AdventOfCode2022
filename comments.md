- Day 1: Missed out on top 100 because I decided to test my code, and then misread part 2

- Day 2: I actually got points o_o, ran into a bug for part 2 but I'm glad to find some signs of hope for this year

- Day 3: Very happy about my performance today!! Got points on both parts despite running into a few bugs. I'm a little bit tilted that I lost out on points to people abusing OpenAI and Copilot to solve the challenge. Can't imagine how they can enforce this unfortunately.

- Day 4: Lost out on points for part 1 because my regex caught the dash as a negative sign, this one is on me. I count at least 2 people who used ChatGPT in today's leaderboard :/

- Day 5: This is on the board for one of the worst input formats. In retrospect I should've hardcoded the input for the extra speed, but I prefer solutions that work on various inputs :")

- Day 6: Did well today, not sure why this is day 6. 

- Day 7: Forgot that directories can have duplicate names..........................................

- Day 8: I tried to be smart and wrote it without brute-force for part 1. It did NOT work, and did NOT extend to part 2 ;---; Need to learn when to use brute-force, gg go next 

- Day 9: Cool problem, but there's too much thinking... I'm just glad I got points today

- Day 10: My code passes the testcase but fails on sample ;w; ended up rewriting my solution because I fear that this solution will get reused for an upcoming challenge 

- Day 11: Took me too long to figure out part 2, I am definitely a lot more washed than last year

- Day 12: New personal best on both parts haha that was insane! Gambled on a grid breadth-first search problem showing up and got rewarded with some crazy points today

- Day 13: Could not fix a bug in time for points... This should've been a simple day to get some points.

- Day 14: PTSD from 2018, spent a bit too much time laughing at the problem. Also couldn't upload this in time because I had to go sleep early for an exam the following morning.

- Day 15: Fun problem to optimize, mildly surprised I got points for part 2 after throwing really badly.

- Day 16: Cool problem but this is never going to finish running on my computer haha
