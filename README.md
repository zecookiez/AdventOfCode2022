# AdventOfCode2022
A series of challenges in the spirit of the holidays for 2022 üéÑ

All of these solutions will be written in Python with the following goals in mind:
1. __Efficiency,__ where an efficient algorithm will do the job without over-killing the problem. I am aiming for a cumulative sub-15 seconds using plain Python 3.9 (no PyPy or JIT compilers) for these tasks.
2. __Organization.__ Avoid duplicate code for better readability and modularity. No üçù code!
3. __Keep it simple!__

As always, the goal is to stay on the leaderboard. However, I am unsure if I can keep up with everyone this year. The past few months have been stressful and I haven't been able to practice like I used to. Hoping to take this year's advent less seriously.
